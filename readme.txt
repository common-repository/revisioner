== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin works in WordPress older than 2.7.x? =

Maybe, but use it at your own risk. I'll not support anyone using outdated WP (or outdated PHP). At the moment of writing this I&#8217;m running this plugin on <strong>WordPress 2.9 and PHP 5.x</strong> and works fine, and was running without problems on <strong>WP 2.8.x and 2.7.x</strong> too. If you run anything below <strong>WP 2.7 and PHP 5.x</strong>, please update for your own good! (and dont ask me for support).

= Why you did this plugin? =

We wanted a <strong>(single) simple</strong> plugin to control the revisions on our blog.

= Are you planning to add more features? =

At first only a few little improvements maybe. But if someone suggest a nice feature, and if I have time enough maybe I'll add it.
But it's not my priority. I want to keep it simple.
